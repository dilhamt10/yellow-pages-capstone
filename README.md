🚀 Yellow Pages CRUD Application – Purwadhika Capstone Project (Module 1)
This project is a simple yet functional Yellow Pages CRUD application built using Python as part of my Purwadhika Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp. 

It features a structured dataframe containing:
📌 Name of Place
🏢 Category of Place
📍 Location Address
🏷️ Postal Code
📞 Telephone Number

Core Features:
➕ Append new places - CREATE
✔️ Display all stored places - READ
✏️ Update specific columns (choose up to 5 or skip updates by entering 'N') - UPDATE
❌ Delete places using index - DELETE
📅 Timestamp Feature – Automatically records modification time under the "Updated at" column when a place is added or modified/updated

This project is a step toward building scalable CRUD applications with an extra layer of data tracking for better usability. 
More enhancements to come!
